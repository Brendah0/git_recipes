    <h2>Coffee Jelly worth Saiki's money.</h2>
    <p>This coffee jelly will blow your mind, mostly because it tastes just like regular coffee jelly and it would most likely make Kusuo's life more disastrous.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instant coffee</li>
      <li>Pack of gelatin</li>
      <li>Canned whipped cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure out 2 cups of coffee and deposit into a medium saucepan, saving about ¾ cup of coffee in a dish on the side. Dissolve one pack of gelatin into the coffee on the side and give a tiny whisk. 

    </li>
      <li>Take the saucepan to the stove on a medium low flame until it reaches a rolling boil and then dump in the gelatin coffee mixture. Tiny whisk over medium low until the mixture is completely incorporated. Turn off heat and let cool for about 5 minutes.

    </li>
      <li>Once it’s cooled down, ladle into serving vessel of choice and gently place into fridge for at least 3 hours until gelatinous.

    </li>
      <li>Remove from fridge and add canned whipped cream on top.

    </li>
    </ol>
