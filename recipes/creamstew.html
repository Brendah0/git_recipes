    <h2>A scrumptious meal by Raiden Mei</h2>

    <p>Finally found a recipe by Mei. It took me this long because I'm a dumbass who didn't even try.</p>
    <p>Recipe is from the manga <em>Valkaries Dining Escapades</em> chapter 3, which will be linked at the end of this page.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Main Dish</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pieces of chicken 500g</li>
      <li>potatoes 200g</li>
      <li>carrots 75g</li>
      <li>half an onion 150g</li>
      <li>celery 75g</li>
      <li>mushrooms 200g</li>
      <li>broccoli 100g</li>
      <li>4 pieces of bread(french loaf recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>milk 400ml</li>
      <li>flour 50g</li>
      <li>butter 50g</li>
      <li>white wine 50g</li>
      <li>chicken stock/water 200ml</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Optional(for sauce))</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>thyme 10g</li>
      <li>sage 8g</li>
      <li>green onions 10g</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the carrots, potatoes, celery and onions. Chop the mushrooms in half and cut the broccoli into small stalks. Melt the butter at a low temperature.</li>
      <li>Debone the chicken and cut into bite-sized pieces. Season and batter with salt and pepper for 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> On a low flame, add some cooking oil to the pot and add the chicken. Fry the chicken on both sides until it turns a golden crispy brown.</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken and add the carrots, potatoes, celery, onions, mushrooms and broccoli and stir fry them.</li>
      <li>Add the white wine and evaporate it over high heat. When the white wine has fully evaporated, add the chicken stock or water until it covers half the vegetables. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the vegetables simmer, start preparing the sauce.</li>
      <li>In another pot, add the melted butter and flour. When small bubbles start appearing, slowly stir while adding milk. The cream sauce should be done after continually stirring for 10 minutes over low heat.(For a thicker creamier sauce, replace half the milk with whipping cream.)</li>
      <li>Add the cooked chicken and vegetables into the cream sauce and simmer for another 10 minutes for the chicken and vegetables to absorb the cream sauce.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper for taste and garnish.</li>
    </ol>
